Stardog Helm Chart
==================

This chart installs Stardog, either single node or a cluster with a ZooKeeper ensemble,
which is required for the cluster. The chart pulls the latest version of Stardog from
Docker Hub and does not support rolling upgrades.

Chart Details
-------------

This chart does the following:

- Creates a ZooKeeper ensemble from the incubated ZooKeeper Helm chart
- Creates a Stardog Cluster StatefulSet configured with readiness and liveness probes
- Deploys a single node Stardog if the cluster is disabled
- Creates a load balanced service for Stardog
- Optionally specify the anti-affinity for the pods
- Optionally tune resource requests and limits for the pods
- Optionally tune JVM resources for Stardog

Upgrades
--------

Stardog Cluster does not currently support rolling upgrades. To upgrade Stardog on k8s,
make sure there are no running transactions and then delete the Stardog pods and
redeploy them with the new Stardog version. If there are manual
steps required as part of the upgrade process k8s jobs will need to be used
to run the steps on the Stardog home directories in the PVCs.

See the [Stardog documentation](https://www.stardog.com/docs/#_upgrading_the_cluster)
for instructuions on how to upgrade Stardog Cluster.

### Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

Version 2.x of the charts deploys ZooKeeper 3.5 instead of 3.4. Before upgrading the
charts make sure you have upgraded to Stardog 7.4.2 or later, which includes preview
support for ZooKeeper 3.5.

After upgrading Stardog you can upgrade the charts by taking down your full deployment
of Stardog and ZooKeeper pods (but do not delete the PVCs with Stardog home data) by
following this process:
- Stop all traffic and updates to your cluster or wait for them to end. You can ensure there
are no transactions running on a database with `stardog-admin db status <db name>`.
- Backup Stardog home and copy the backup out of the k8s environment. The
[Stardog documentation](https://www.stardog.com/docs/#_backing_up_and_restoring) includes
an overview of the various options for backing up Stardog. Only S3 backups will copy
data outside of the pods. If you use another backup method you will need to manually
copy the data off the volume or snapshot the volumes to ensure the data is stored in
a separate location.
- Shutdown all Stardog and ZooKeeper pods (e.g. using `helm delete`).
- Install the new 2.x charts with the same version of Stardog you were running previously.

Limitations
-----------

At this time namespaceOverride is currently only supported for single-node deploys
because the downstream ZooKeeper chart does not support namespaceOverride for ZooKeeper
3.5 deployments.

The chart does not currently support:
- cache targets
- rolling upgrades
- pinning chart version to Stardog versions, the chart tracks the latest available Stardog,
it's not guaranteed to work with any Stardog version
